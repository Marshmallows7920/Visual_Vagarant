Character list

Ledgend

Camera/player (static)

Map (25 x 25)
	FOV (5 x 5)

Objectives

Threat chance (15%) case of 3/20

Problems
- Had to figure out how to move the character
	used memory (explain)

- Had to figure out how random events would run
	show random gen code

- Had to figure out how code would run at different places
	times 4 

- Had to figure out how code can run across forums
	show public

- Had to figure out how to save game state in a simpler way than kavin's
because it would take too long to initialize 6250 memories

- Figured out how to have a save game state when on other events from the forum
	- new problem, returning to old state and not let it reset.
		- at the same time variables running to check if event was completed
		- and same time a loop running to update all values across the forms

we were able to finish all that only this week and it was a lot of tedious work, but than we could get
started on the story. Hence, all the story line was not complete. You noticed how all the labels are not
in proper coding ethics, because with the tedious work alone, Combined we have got around 54 hours and it
would have taken an additioal 12 to get all that organized. and that 12 was too valuble to use on renaming
labels and buttons.
